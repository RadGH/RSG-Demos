# No Silent Shelving

The core delivery rule. Restated here so it lives in versioned docs, not just in CLAUDE.md.

## The rule

When the user sends a list of requests (bug fixes, features, suggestions), the default contract is:

1. **Every item must be implemented in the same response cycle.** Scope is the user's call, not yours.
2. **If you cannot implement an item, call it out BEFORE you start work** — name the items and the reason, and wait for confirmation. If the user doesn't confirm a deferral, implement it.
3. **Never silently shelve an item into a "deferred" note in the changelog.** If it's not done, say so explicitly in the response text.
4. **No milestone is "shipped" until every item from the user's last message is either implemented or explicitly deferred with confirmation.** Do not run `release.sh` before that.
5. **At the end of a multi-item request, audit your own work** against the original list — ✅ done with file:line, or ⚠️ deferred with reason.

## Where deferred items go

Anything deferred must land in the **wishlist** (`public/assets/wishlist.html`) with:

- A clear label
- The reason for deferral
- Enough context that a future session knows how to pick it up

The wishlist is the single source of truth for "things we agreed to do later." Changelog deferrals are not acceptable.
